# Repository for the monitoring and reporting of state-level propaganda campaigns on Reddit and other social media

It has become increasingly clear that totalitarian states around the world frequently mount disinformation campaigns on western social media in order to create confusion and doubt amongst "Netizens", and "convert" them to the desired line of thought. 

Twitter and Facebook have implemented [measures](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/information_operations_directed_at_Hong_Kong.html) to contain such disinformation. However, there has not been such decisive action taken by Reddit administrators, therefore this repository aims to record the disinformation techniques used and instances of disinformation on Reddit in the hope that it will make people more aware of when a state actor may be trying to influence their thoughts. 

(The disinformation techniques disclosed here can however be used to spot attempts at disinformation on other media platforms as well, but this repository is aimed primarily at Reddit.)

As of October 2019, the current biggest operation is being run by Chinese authorities to spread misinformation about the Hong Kong anti-extradition protests. Therefore the initial focus of this repository will be on CCP disinformation, but in due time the focus can also be extended to other regimes also known to spread disinformation on western social media such as Russia.

What now follows is a nested list of disinformation campaigns suspected to be active and techniques/talking points used, but first a notice:

### Notice on opinions versus disinformation

Stating an opinion does not make one a state actor spreading disinformation. This project does not aim to demonise, doxx or otherwise harrass holders of opinions. 

Disinformation, as opposed to a statement of opinion, is the use of particular wording and literary techniques to mislead, confuse and/or convert readers.

## China, on Hong Kong

## Russia, on Ukraine/Crimea
