# Repository for the monitoring and reporting of state-level propaganda campaigns on Reddit and other social media

It has become increasingly clear that totalitarian states around the world frequently mount disinformation campaigns on western social media in order to create confusion and doubt amongst "Netizens", and "convert" them to the desired line of thought. 

Twitter and Facebook have implemented [measures](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/information_operations_directed_at_Hong_Kong.html) to contain such disinformation. However, there has not been such decisive action taken by Reddit administrators, therefore this repository aims to record the disinformation techniques used and instances of disinformation on Reddit in the hope that it will make people more aware of when a state actor may be trying to influence their thoughts. 

(The disinformation techniques disclosed here can however be used to spot attempts at disinformation on other media platforms as well, but this repository is aimed primarily at Reddit.)

As of October 2019, the current biggest operation is being run by Chinese authorities to spread misinformation about the Hong Kong anti-extradition protests. Therefore the initial focus of this repository will be on CCP disinformation, but in due time the focus can also be extended to other regimes also known to spread disinformation on western social media such as Russia.

What now follows is a nested list of disinformation campaigns suspected to be active and techniques/talking points used, but first a notice:

### Notice on opinions versus disinformation

Stating an opinion does not make one a state actor spreading disinformation. This project does not aim to demonise, doxx or otherwise harrass holders of opinions. 

Disinformation, as opposed to a statement of opinion, is the use of particular wording and literary techniques to mislead, confuse and/or convert readers.

## 1 China, on Hong Kong

1.1 Claiming, without evidence, that the protests are planned, organised or funded by external groups, such as:

     1.1.1 The CIA
 
     1.1.2 Falun Gong
 
     1.1.3 Tibetans
 
     1.1.4 Any foreign government
 
 1.2 Making misleading or untrue claims about the motivations of the protestors and/or public sentiment in Hong Kong, for example:
 
     1.2.1 The protests are a fringe youth movement with no support from the general public
     
     1.2.2 The majority of the public in Hong Kong is pro-Beijing
     
     1.2.3 The protests were sparked by economic factors, jealousy of China, or a combination of the two, for example: "Rich kids angry at a declining HK economy"
     
     1.2.4 Any variation of "spoilt rich kids" used in describing the protestors or the motivations of the protests
     
     1.2.5 Claiming that the protests are motivated by racism/hatred of mainland Chinese people
 
 1.3 Claiming to be a native Hong Konger, then using this claim to try to legitimise misleading or untrue facts or to present an opinion that would be unpopular in Hong Kong as a majority opinion. Examples detailed in section 1.2
 
 1.4 Spreading disinformation about the terror attacks committed by gangs and raptors:
 
     1.4.1 Denying that the events happened and/or calling news reports of them fake news
     
     1.4.2 Saying that the victims deserved it
     
     1.4.3 Claiming that it was a deliberate false flag attack
     
     1.4.4 Claiming that the gangs/raptors were acting in self defense, and the victims attacked first
     
     1.4.5 Claiming that it was in fact protestors who attacked train passengers
     
 1.5 Cherry-picking events caught on video to present a misleading picture of what happened

 1.6 On the media:
 
     1.6.1 Claiming, implying or presenting Chinese state media as being unbiased and a source of truth
     
     1.6.2 Claiming that respected western and/or Hong Kong media (obviously discounting media that is not trusted, such as Fox and Co.) knowingly spreads disinformation in order to discredit the CCP
     
     1.6.3 Making "they are both as bad as eachother" arguments about (respected) western/HK media and Chinese state media. 
     
 1.7 Pulling the race card:
 
     1.7.1 Calling pro-democracy lawmakers racist against the Chinese
     
     1.7.2 Calling any criticism of the CCP racist
     
     1.7.3 Claiming the protestors are motivated by racism against mainland Chinese people (covered by point 1.2.5)
